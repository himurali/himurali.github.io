**I was one of the Chief Organizers and Co-founders of Bangalore Plog Run whose aim was to 1> Make plogging a fitness activity**
**2> Enable a healthy environment in the city**
**3> Build a community of Ploggers who care for a plastic-free lifestyle.”**

Plastic pollution & climate change are two sides of the same coin. As a product of extracting and refining fossil fuels for energy, the amount of plastic produced is influenced by the demand for and production of oil and gas. We should create alternative platform for replacing plastic and encouraging native products like jute, cotton etc to reduce the impact of plastic on environment and reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.

Littering has become a concerning global issue that affects all of us. Usage of excessive plastic is alarming. The Bangalore Plog Run aims to be a popular plogging initiative looking at creating awareness on managing plastic waste” said Prashanth Prakash, Chairman, United Way Bengaluru.

Participation was made easy as interested volunteers can register through www.bengaluru.plog.run website. I was responsible for 
**1> Designing the Platform for community engagement**
**2> Partnership to Build a community of Ploggers across bangalore - around 100 locations - 8000 ploggers.”**

.

> The Plog run movement was a grand success and was the first time such a movement had happened in the Country.
