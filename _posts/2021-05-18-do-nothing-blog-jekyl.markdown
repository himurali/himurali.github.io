**Have been building websites and web stacks to teach and also for my projects. I have been configuring Amazon servers / google cloud servers and i always felt some thing was missing. What was that ? My own virtual space ? I had tried many spaces - wordpress, blog spot to list a few. I had to give up writing on these spaces after initial effort, for i found them too complex and inherently had lot of blocks in their design. I had no control about the style and formatting. Data belonged to some one else. Login/Logout asked for passwrods which i forgot anyway. Hence my writing ceased to flow. Many of the ideas simply evaporated and there was no space i could engage with the people around the world. I spoke to my friend and techie Bhanu who suggested this old tool Jekyyll . He mentioned with this one can set up the blog site briskly and called it Do nothing blog. I set up the blog and also hosted on Github in a matter of minutes. Simplest, Easiest and the best bet for my needs. Wanted to pay homage to the man behind jekyl. I discovered one of the Co-founders of Github was the man behind Jekyl. His name is [Tom Preston](https://tom.preston-werner.com/) .**

I visited his blog and now i am inspired by his work and his writings. Tech Leadership, Deep Entrepeunership and Great Writing - all in combo is Tom as a personality. Simplicity is the essence of Universality said Mahatma Gandhi - and what more proof that this tool he build is being adapted universally.

Tom is a prolific writer and here is an interview that is inspiring for start ups to learn from him about simplicity and building for the global audience.
